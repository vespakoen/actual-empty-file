# actual-empty-file

This is used to shim out modules in facebook's `node-haste` module.
Basically a replacement for https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/blob/master/lib/_empty.js
Compatibility goes way back to the first node version, and it's 100% bug free.

## Install

Uhh, are you sure?

## Use

Don't use this, it's most likely useless for you!
